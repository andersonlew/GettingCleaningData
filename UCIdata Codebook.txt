From the data set, the following text files were merged:  
    - ID <- test/subject_test.txt: A vector giving the patient’s ID (1:30)
    - Labels <- test/y_test.txt: A vector stating the patient’s activity (1:6) 
	WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING 
    - Group <- This variable was created to distinguish between ‘test’ patients and ’training’ patients
    - feature.txt:  A vector of column names for test/X_test.txt  
	Only mean and std were kept.  This data come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. A complete definition of the names are given in the data set under the features_info.txt document.  Here is a list of these variables (column names):
